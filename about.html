        <p><br><h2>Why the Informed Consent Model of Gender-Affirming Care?</h2>

            The informed consent model for gender-affirming treatment, proposed in a number of transgender health guidelines and by practicing clinicians seeks to better acknowledge and support patients right of, and their capability for, personal autonomy in choosing care options without the requirement of external evaluations or therapy by mental health professionals. Through a discussion of risks and benefits of possible treatment options with the patient—a discussion that considers the current state of scientific knowledge as well as the cultural and social context of treatment decisions and that respects the patient's capacity for self-knowledge—clinicians work to assist patients in making decisions. This approach recognizes that patients are the only ones who are best positioned, in the context of their lived experience, to assess and judge beneficence (i.e., the potential improvement in their welfare that might be achieved), and it also affords prescribing clinicians a better and fuller sense of how a particular patient balances principles of nonmaleficence and beneficence. Ultimately, clinicians' use of the informed consent model can lead to the possibility of a richer understanding of the patient and the potential for better patient care overall. However, the model does not remove the expectation that the clinician will inquire about and understand the possible impact of gender dysphoria on the patient's emotional state and psychosocial functioning; in fact, it assumes that this will factor into the discussion of risks and benefits but allows the patients themselves to weigh these potential impacts. On the other hand, the SOC's continued reliance on mental health professionals to determine eligibility and readiness for treatment perpetuates a message that neither the patient nor the prescribing clinician is capable of a nuanced discussion of gender variance and its management. <br></p>
